The extension makes translating a small amount of text or individual phrases as comfortable as possible. The translation is carried out directly in the current tab, in a pop-up window. The translator only works with Russian and English (I have no need for others). There are buttons for copying the translation to the clipboard and quickly clearing the text field. It is also possible to quickly switch languages.
